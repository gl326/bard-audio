=== 1. Introduction ===

Elephant is a struct/array serialization system that offers extended functionality beyond the typical JSON functions:
  - Serialization of arrays, structs, and scalar datatypes
  - Circular references are stored and recreated correctly
  - Structs made with constructors are recreated using the constructor
  - Constructed structs can have schemas to control which variables are serialized and how
  - Constructed structs can have read/write callbacks

When using Elephant, some considerations must be taken into account:
  - Constructors must be in global scope i.e. in a script
  - Whilst static methods in constructors will persist, non-static methods cannot be serialized
  - Constructor schemas are shallow without nesting/recursion, and arrays cannot have schemas
  - Upon deserialization, structs are rebuilt by new-ing the constructor with zero arguments
  - Arrays are limited to 65534 elements and structs are limited to 65533 member variables

Arrays are assumed to have flexible typing, though arrays that are found to have a consistent datatype throughout
are optimised automatically when serializing. Because deserialization creates structs by calling constructors with
zero arguments, significant care must be taken to ensure that no unintended code is executed during deserialization.
Preferably, constructors should only set default variable values and structs shouldn't alter state outside of their
scope on instantiation.

    N.B. When using Elephant it is very important to ensure constructor methods are static. A non-static method
         cannot be serialized and will instead be set to <undefined> upon deserialization.

Elephant introduces a handful of macros that are useful for interacting with the library. These are explained in
further detail later in the document.

Custom datatypes that can be used with Elephant schemas:
    buffer_any
    buffer_array
    buffer_struct
    buffer_undefined

Schema definition for constructors:
    ELEPHANT_SCHEMA

Callbacks, and callback state:
    ELEPHANT_PRE_WRITE_METHOD
    ELEPHANT_POST_WRITE_METHOD
    ELEPHANT_PRE_READ_METHOD
    ELEPHANT_POST_READ_METHOD
    ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION
    ELEPHANT_IS_DESERIALIZING





=== 2. Functions ===

Elephant has five public functions that can be used:
    
    ElephantWrite(target, [buffer])
        Serializes the given target data and writes it to the given buffer, starting at the buffer_tell() position.
        This function uses buffer_write() and will move the buffer head as it writes. If no buffer is provided then
        a new buffer is created that fits the serialized data. This function calls ELEPHANT_PRE_WRITE_METHOD and
        ELEPHANT_POST_WRITE_METHOD for constructed structs, and ELEPHANT_IS_DESERIALIZING is set to <false>.
        ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION will contain the constructor schema version that Elephant is using to serialize data.
    
    ElephantExportString(target)
        As above, but returns a base64 encoded version of the buffer. This function also performs compression on the
        buffer.
    
    ElephantRead(buffer)
        Deserializes Elephant data from a buffer, starting at the buffer_tell() point. This function uses
        buffer_read() and will move the buffer head as it reads data. This function calls ELEPHANT_PRE_READ_METHOD
        and ELEPHANT_POST_READ_METHOD for constructed structs, and ELEPHANT_IS_DESERIALIZING is set to <true>.
        ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION will contain the constructor schema version that Elephant found in the source data.
    
    ElephantImportString(string)
        As above, but takes a string rather than a buffer. This string should have been created by ElephantExportString().
    
    ElephantDuplicate(target)
        Makes an identical copy of the target. Unlike ElephantWrite(), this function ignores schemas and will copy
        all member variables and non-static methods. This function will recreate constructed structs appropriately
        and will also correctly duplicate circular references.





=== 3. Schemas ===

Schemas may be defined for constructors by using the macro ELEPHANT_SCHEMA to define a struct literal. This struct
literal contains schema versions as the top-level keys, and member variables names with associated datatype as
second-level keys.

If no schema is defined then all member variables for the struct will be serialized using the generic buffer_any
datatype. This typically leads to large buffers and is much slower to both serialize and deserialize and should
generally be avoided. Try to declare a schema whenever you can.

Schemas must be defined by setting ELEPHANT_SCHEMA in a constructor e.g.

    function Example() constructor
    {
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
        
        ELEPHANT_SCHEMA
        {
            v1 : {
                x : buffer_f64,
                y : buffer_f64,
            },
        }
        
        static SetPosition = function(_x, _y)
        {
            x = _x;
            y = _y;
        }
    }

Top-level keys in a struct delineate schema versions. Versioning is critical for writing robust code that will work
as your project develops and changes. Schema versions must start with a lowercase "v" and must be followed by a
positive integer from 1 to 255 inclusive.

    N.B. It is very important that you do not ever remove schema versions! If you remove a schema version then any
         old files that use the old schema version cannot be recovered, which is very likely to break your project.

Variables defined in a schema can take any of the following datatypes, partially shared with GameMaker's native
constants that are used for buffer access.

    N.B. Elephant does no type checking for scalar values in the interests of speed. Please ensure that the value
         you're serializing matches the datatype in the schema
    
     1  buffer_u8         Unsigned 8-bit integer, a positive value from 0 to 255
     2  buffer_s8         Signed 8-bit integer, a positive or negative value from -128 to 127
     3  buffer_u16        Unsigned 16-bit integer, a positive value from 0 - 65535
     4  buffer_s16        Signed 16-bit integer, a positive or negative value from -32,768 to 32,767
     5  buffer_u32        Unsigned 32-bit integer, a positive value from 0 to 4,294,967,295
     6  buffer_s32        Signed 32-bit integer, a positive or negative value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
     7  buffer_f16        16-bit float
     8  buffer_f32        32-bit float
     9  buffer_f64        64-bit float
    10  buffer_bool       Boolean value, can only be 0 or 1
    11  buffer_string     String of any size, with a null terminator
    12  buffer_u64        An unsigned 64bit integer
    13  buffer_text       String of any size, with a null terminator (there is no difference between buffer_text and buffer_string)
    14  buffer_any        Datatype can be any serializable data. This is the default when serializing content in arrays or structs that have no schema
    15  buffer_array      Data is an array. Array elements themselves can be any datatype, though Elephant will optimise arrays with a consistent datatype. Arrays are limited to 65534 elements.
    16  buffer_struct     Data is a struct, either anonymous or created by a constructor. Structs are limited to 65533 member variables
    17  buffer_undefined  Undefined value, using GameMaker's <undefined> datatype. This is equivalent to <null> in JavaScript





=== 4. Callbacks ===

Elephant allows for the definition of callback methods per constructor. These are executed as follows:

    ELEPHANT_PRE_WRITE_METHOD   Executed immediately before serialization
    ELEPHANT_POST_WRITE_METHOD  Executed immediately after serialization
    ELEPHANT_PRE_READ_METHOD    Executed immediately before deserialization
    ELEPHANT_POST_READ_METHOD   Executed immediately after deserialization

During the execution of callbacks, two macros can be read: ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION and ELEPHANT_IS_DESERIALIZING.
ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION contains the schema version that is being used, whereas ELEPHANT_IS_DESERIALIZING will be
either <true> or <false>. Both variables are set to <undefined> outside of serialization/deserialization.

    function Example() constructor
    {
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
        
        //Distance to the centre of the room
        distance = point_distance(x, y, room_width/2, room_height/2);
        
        ELEPHANT_SCHEMA
        {
            v1 : {
                x : buffer_f64,
                y : buffer_f64,
                distance : buffer_f64,
            },
            v2 : {
                x : buffer_f64,
                y : buffer_f64,
            }
        }
        
        ELEPHANT_POST_READ_METHOD
        {
            //After deserializing the struct, update the distance to the centre of the room
            //We only need to run this code for v2 schemas because v1 serializes distance
            if (ELEPHANT_SCHEMA_VERSION == 2)
            {
                distance = point_distance(x, y, room_width/2, room_height/2);
            }
        }
        
        static SetPosition = function(_x, _y)
        {
            x = _x;
            y = _y;
            distance = point_distance(x, y, room_width/2, room_height/2);
        }
    }





=== 5. Binary Format ===

Elephant uses a custom binary format to encode data, the details of which are described below. There are two key
concepts that allow Elephant to handle circular references and constructors.

Elephant serializes/deserializes circular references by associating a unique integer ID with every struct and array
that gets created. Structs and arrays share the same "pool" of IDs such that no struct and array can ever share the
same ID. IDs start at 0 for the first struct/array that is seen and increases by 1 for each additional struct/array.
When a struct or array is deserialized, this unique integer ID can then be used to rebuild circular references.

Constructor indexes work in a similar way. Each constructor is given an ID when it is first seen. If a later struct
uses the same constructor then the constructor index can be translated into the correct constructor function without
having to repeat the construcor name for every struct.



Wrapper:
    u32   header       0x454C4550 a.k.a. UTF-8/ASCII string "ELEP". If this is missing then the data is invalid
    u32   version      The version number of Elephant used to create the data. This is calculated using ((majorVersion << 16) | (minorVersion << 8) | (patchVersion))
    ---   buffer_any   A buffer_any datapoint that encodes the root value - see below
    u32   footer       0x48414E54 a.k.a. UTF-8/ASCII string "HANT". If this is missing then the data is invalid



buffer_any:
    u8    datatype   Indicates the datatype of content to follow. Matches the list of constants laid out above (buffer_array, buffer_u8, buffer_string etc.)
    ---   content    Content that this datapoint describes. For scalar data, this is the value itself stored using the datatype



Scalar datatype (buffer_string, buffer_f32, buffer_u8 etc.):
    ---   content   The value itself stored using the datatype



buffer_array:
    u16   length       Number of elements in the array. If this value is 0 then no datatype nor content follows. If the length is 65535 (0xFFFF) then special behaviour should be executed, see below
    u8    datatype     Datatype to use to deserialize following data. This can be any of the constants laid out above, including buffer_any
    ---   content[0]   Content for the 0th element
          etc.

buffer_array, circular reference, length = 65535 (0xFFFF):
    u16   length            0xFFFF. This indicates that the struct/array has already been seen before and that this struct/array reference should be duplicated
    u16   reference index   Index of the struct/array to use



buffer_struct:
    u16      length             Number of member variables for this struct. If this value is 0 then no key/value pairs follow. If the length is 65535 or 65534 (0xFFFF or 0xFFFE) then special behaviour should be executed, see below
    string   variable name[0]   Name of the 0th member variable as a null-terminated string
    ---      buffer_any[0]      buffer_any datapoint that encodes the value of the 0th member variable
             etc.

buffer_struct, circular reference, length = 65535 (0xFFFF):
    u16  0xFFFF ("Length")  0xFFFF. This indicates that the struct/array has already been seen before and that this struct/array reference should be duplicated
    u16  reference index    Index of the struct/array to use

buffer_struct, constructor with schema,  length = 65534 (0xFFFE),  schema version > 0:
   u16        length               0xFFFE. This indicates that the struct was instantiated using a constructor
   u16        constructor index    Index of the constructor that was used to create the struct
  (string)   (constructor name)   (If the constructor index is new then the name of the constructor function follows as a string)
   u8         version              The schema version that was used to serialize the content that follows
   ---        content[0]           Content for the 0th member variable, the name and datatype of which is determined by the schema
              etc.

buffer_struct, constructor without schema,  length = 65534 (0xFFFE),  schema version == 0:
   u16        length               0xFFFE. This indicates that the struct was instantiated using a constructor
   u16        constructor index    Index of the constructor that was used to create the struct
  (string)   (constructor name)   (If the constructor index is new then the name of the constructor function follows as a string)
   u8         schema version       0x00. This indicates that no schema was available for the constructor at the time the data was saved
   string     name[0]              Name of the 0th member variable as a null-terminated string
   ---        buffer_any[0]        buffer_any datapoint that encodes the value of the 0th member variable
              etc.
